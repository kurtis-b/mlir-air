# Transformer-Layer Execution Studies — Port Plan

Porting the transformer-layer execution-strategy studies from the AMD IRON repository
(`iron`, commit `1e014c1`) into MLIR-AIR, then building two follow-on capabilities on the
resulting measurement harness: SOTA model coverage via sliding-window attention, and
quantized inference.

These documents are the working plan. They live in the repository rather than the published
docs site (`mkdocs.yml` excludes `plans/`), because they describe work in progress rather than
how to use MLIR-AIR.

## Status board

Update the status column as phases land. A phase is `done` only when its gate passes — see
[13-verification-and-acceptance.md](13-verification-and-acceptance.md).

| Phase | Gate | Status |
|---|---|---|
| A — AIE2P kernels | Every kernel compiles to `.o` with Peano; compile-only lit passes | not started |
| B — runtime seam | Multi-ELF runlist on hardware: numerically identical to sequential, lower latency | not started |
| C — operators | Each operator passes `np.isclose` at registry tolerance; registry rows written; shape coverage resolved | not started |
| D — block integration | One full transformer layer matches the torch reference on hardware | not started |
| E — execution strategies | All four modes agree with the reference; dispatch vectors differ as predicted | not started |
| F — study harness | `execution-smoke-test` yields ≥1 `run_status=passed` row per measurement CSV | not started |
| G — unattended runner + CI | Full profile run completes with a complete `results_manifest.json` | not started |
| Goal 1 — sliding window | `make verify` passes with window-crossing prompts | not started |
| Goal 2 — quantization | Second quantized model passes a gate that exercises the quantized path | not started |

## The one thing to check first

Phase B rests on an unproven assumption: that separately-compiled ELF artifacts can share a
single `pyxrt.hw_context` and be submitted as one runlist on NPU2. The `pyxrt` module API
supports it in principle, but the repository's only existing runlist usage
(`test/xrt/24_ctrlpkt_config_2gemms_4x4/test.cpp`) shares one context and one kernel, which
does not demonstrate the multi-artifact case.

If that assumption fails, three of the four execution modes collapse into one and the study
loses its central axis. **Spike it before committing to any other phase.** See
[05-phase-b-runtime-seam.md](05-phase-b-runtime-seam.md).

## Provenance

The source is `iron` commit `1e014c1` "Add transformer-layer execution-strategy studies"
(145 files, ~58.6k insertions), validated there by an 888/888-job suite run. This plan was
reviewed by Codex before approval; findings that materially changed it are marked `[Codex]`
in the phase documents.
